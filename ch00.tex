{\it Exercises for Think Java} is a companion volume to {\it Think Java 2nd Edition} by Allen B. Downey and Chris Mayfield 
\url{https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/}

Evergreen Valley College, where I teach, has been encouraging faculty to use low-cost or open source textbooks. In this spirit, the Computer Science department decided to use {\it Think Java} for our introductory Computer Science course. While the book met most of our needs, we wanted more exercises for students to practice programming. There were also some topics that we cover in our course that were not in the book. Thus, we decided to add some material and more exercises.

Instead of editing the original book, which is open source, I have decided to make this a separate book for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Inserting many exercises, some of which require a great deal of explanation, breaks up the flow of the material. 
\item The modified book would no longer match the print version, which some students prefer to use.
\end{enumerate}
