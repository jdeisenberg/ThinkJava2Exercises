\chapter{Loops and Strings}

\section{The \java{do}-\java{while} Loop}
The following section is \copyright Alan Downey and Chris Mayfield, and is material that was originally in {\it Think Java}, but later removed. I think it's an important topic, so I am including it, slightly modified, here.

\index{pretest loop}
\index{loop!pretest}

The \java{while} and \java{for} statements are {\bf pretest loops}; that is, they test the condition first and at the beginning of each pass through the loop.

\index{posttest loop}
\index{loop!posttest}
\index{do-while}

Java also provides a {\bf posttest loop}: the \java{do}-\java{while} statement.
This type of loop is useful when you need to run the body of the loop at least once.

%NOTE: can we find an example that's better using do-while than using while-break?

For example, you can use a \java{do}-\java{while} loop to keep reading input until it's valid:

\begin{code}
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
boolean okay;
do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    if (in.hasNextDouble()) {
        okay = true;
    } else {
        okay = false;
        String word = in.next();
        System.err.println(word + " is not a number");
    }
} while (!okay);
double x = in.nextDouble();
\end{code}

Although this code looks complicated, it is essentially only three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Display a prompt.
\item Check the input; if invalid, display an error and start over.
\item Read the input.
\end{enumerate}

\index{System.err}

The code uses a flag variable, \java{okay}, to indicate whether we need to repeat the loop body.
If \java{hasNextDouble()} returns \java{false}, we consume the invalid input by calling \java{next()}.
We then display an error message via \java{System.err}.
The loop terminates when \java{hasNextDouble()} return \java{true}.

Again, the important difference between \java{while} and \java{do}-\java{while} is this: In a \java{while} loop, the test happens {\em before} the loop body is executed. If the condition evaluates to \java{false}, the loop body doesn't get executed.

In a \java{do}-\java{while} loop, the loop body is always executed at least once, and only then is the condition evaluated. This turns out to be a good choice for validating input, because you must get the user's input before you can determine whether it's valid or not.

\section{Pre vs. Post Increment and Decrement}

\index{increment!pre vs. post}
\index{decrement!pre vs. post}

The book discusses the increment \java{++} and decrement \java{--} operators, which increase or decrease a variable's value by one.

You can put these operators before or after a variable name. For example, in this code fragment:

\begin{code}
int n = 47;
n++; // n post-increment to 48
++n; // n pre-increment to 49
n--; // n post-decrement to 48
--n; // n pre-decrement to 47
\end{code}

When a variable is all by itself, there is no difference between the operator before or after the variable. However, you may see people using these operators inside an expression, and then there is a very big difference.

Consider this code fragment:

\begin{code}
int n = 47;
int result = n++;
System.out.println("result is now " + n);
\end{code}

Because this is a post-increment, Java access the value of \java{n} and assigns it to \java{result}, and {\em then} adds one to \java{n}. It's as if we wrote it this way:

\begin{code}
int n = 47;
int result = n;
n = n + 1; // increment after assignment
System.out.println("result is now " + result);
\end{code}

If we place the \java{++} {\em before} the variable (a pre-increment):

\begin{code}
int n = 47;
int result = ++n;
System.out.println("result is now " + result);
\end{code}

Java will increment \java{n} {\em before} it assigns the value to \java{result}; it's as if we had written:

\begin{code}
int n = 47;
n = n + 1; // increment before assignment
int result = n;
System.out.println("result is now " + result);
\end{code}

While the following is not something you should do in your programs, you may see other people coding this way, and you'll need to understand it:

\begin{code}
int a = 7;
int b = 11;
int c = a++ * --b;
\end{code}

Here's the trick. First, find all the pre-increments and pre-decrements and evaluate them before the expression:

\begin{code}
int a = 7;
int b = 11;
b = b - 1; // do the pre-decrement
int c = a++ * b;
\end{code}

Then, find all the post-increments and post-decrements and evaluate them after the expression:

\begin{code}
int a = 7;
int b = 11;
b = b - 1;
int c = a * b;
a = a + 1;
\end{code}

Now there are no more increment and decrement operators, and you have just ``plain Java expressions,'' with the result being \java{c} being assigned \java{66}.

\section{Compound Assignment}
\index{compound assignment}
\index{assignment!compound}
The book mentions that you can increment a variable by two in this way:

\begin{code}
int n = 12;
n += 2; // same as n = n + 2;
\end{code}

I read this expression as ``\java{n} plus and becomes two.''

In fact, in any expression where the variable on the left side of the assignment operator is the same as the first variable on the right hand side, you can use this shortcut:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
{\bf This:} & {\bf is the same as:} \\ \hline
\java{n += 2;} & \java{n = n + 2;} \\ \hline
\java{n -= 3;} & \java{n = n - 3;} \\ \hline
\java{n *= 4;} & \java{n = n * 4;} \\ \hline
\java{n /= 5;} & \java{n = n / 5;} \\ \hline
\java{n \%= 6;} & \java{n = n \% 6;} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

You can use compound assignment in more complex expressions:
\java{n += m * 5;} is equivalent to \java{n = n + (m * 5);} However, you can {\em not} use it if the left-hand variable is part of a parenthesized expression. \java{n = (n + 7) * 3;} cannot be simplifed using compound assignment.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
Write a program that asks the user for a starting amount of money, an annual interest rate as a percent, and a number of years. Use this information to print a table that shows the balance with accumulated compound interest. Use a \java{for} loop. Here is what your output might look like:

\begin{stdout}
Enter starting amount: $100
Enter annual percent interest: 5.3
Enter number of years: 4
Year  Balance
0     $100.00
1     $105.30
2     $110.88
3     $116.76
4     $122.95
\end{stdout}

\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
When you go to the store, the clerk doesn't know in advance how many items you want to buy. Instead, they keep totaling the items until they see one of those plastic dividers to indicate that your order is complete.

\index{sentinel value}
\index{value!sentinel}
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for the price of an item until they enter a zero for the price. This is the digital equivalent of the plastic divider. Its technical name is a {\em sentintel value}. As the user enters prices, keep track of the total number of items and sum of the prices.  After encountering the sentinel value, your program will print the number of items purchased, the subtotal, the tax (at a rate of 6.5\%), and the grand total. Here is what the program might look like. Note that it does not allow (or count) negative prices. {\em Hint}: Use a \java{while} loop.

\begin{stdout}
Enter price, or 0 when finished: $3.50    
Enter price, or 0 when finished: $-2
Prices can not be negative.
Enter price, or 0 when finished: $5.99
Enter price, or 0 when finished: $4.83
Enter price, or 0 when finished: $0

Number of items: 3
Subtotal:  $   14.32
Tax:       $    0.93
Total:     $   15.25
\end{stdout}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a sentence (until they press only ENTER). For each sentence, tell how many vowels, consonants, digits, and ``other'' characters are in the sentence.  For this exercise, presume that the letter ``y'' is a vowel. Continue asking for sentences the user presses only the ENTER key for input. When that happens, the \java{String} that you read will equal the empty string \java{""}. You can test this condition to end the loop.

Sample output:

\begin{stdout}
Input a sentence (just ENTER to quit): 4 score & 7 years ago.
Vowels:   7  Consonants:  6
Digits:   2  Others:      7

Input a sentence (just ENTER to quit): 2*x=17
Vowels:   0  Consonants:  1
Digits:   3  Others:      2

Input a sentence (just ENTER to quit): The Quick Brown Fox
Vowels:   5  Consonants: 11
Digits:   0  Others:      3

Input a sentence (just ENTER to quit):
\end{stdout}

{\em Hint}: Make \java{String} variables with contents such as \java{"aeiouy"}, \java{"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz"}, etc. and use \java{indexOf} to determine whether a character belongs to that group of characters.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Write a method called \java{switchOrder}, which takes a \java{String} parameter with a person's name in the form \java{"first middle last"} and returns the name in the form \java{"last, first middle"}.  Your code should work for people with only a single name, people with no middle name, and people with several middle names.
Use a \java{while} loop with the \java{indexOf} and \java{substring} methods to do this exercise. (You could do it more easily with the \java{lastIndexOf} method, but we want you to get practice using loops.)

Write a \java{main} method that uses a \java{while} loop to repeatedly ask the user for a name and then calls the \java{switchOrder} method and prints the result. Repeat until the user presses just ENTER. Here is some sample output:

\begin{stdout}
Input a name (just ENTER to quit): Grace Murray Hopper
Hopper, Grace Murray

Input a name (just ENTER to quit): Donald Knuth   
Knuth, Donald

Input a name (just ENTER to quit): Prince
Prince

Input a name (just ENTER to quit): C. Anthony Richard Hoare
Hoare, C. Anthony Richard

Input a name (just ENTER to quit): 
\end{stdout}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Write a program named{\it PhoneWord.java} that prompts the user for a ``phone word,'' an alphabetic mnemonic for a phone number. Then, print out the phone number corresponding to that sequence.

Here is how your program must translate letters to numbers:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
ABC & 2 \\ \hline
DEF & 3 \\ \hline
GHI & 4 \\ \hline
JKL & 5 \\ \hline
MNO & 6 \\ \hline
PQRS & 7 \\ \hline
TUV & 8  \\ \hline
WXYZ & 9  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Keep digits as digits (see the second example output). Don't forget about zero!

You must accept letters in either upper or lower case. If the phone word translates to more than seven digits, keep only the first seven. If the phone word translates to fewer than seven digits, print an error message. Ignore any characters other than a letter or digit.

Here is an example of several runs of the program:

\begin{stdout}
Enter a phone word: warbler
The number is 9272537.

Enter a phone word: GOOD4U2
The number is 4663482.

Enter a phone word: OMG
Your phone word is not long enough for a phone number.

Enter a phone word: GREAT DEALS
The number is 4732833.

Enter a phone word: got-food?
The number is 4683663.

\end{stdout}

{\em Hint}: Do {\em not} check the input string to see if its length is greater than or equal to seven. The string 
\java{"C-A-T-S!"} is eight characters long, but there are only four letters, so it will not translate to a valid phone word.

Instead, convert all the letters in the string to digits, no matter how many or how few, and {\em then} check the length of the result to see if it is seven characters or more.

Extra challenge: Print the phone number with a hyphen; for example: 473-2833.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Given an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive), print a pattern of stars based on that number. Example:

\begin{stdout}
Enter number of rows: 4
*
**
***
****
\end{stdout}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Given an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive), print an inverted triangle of plus signs based on that number. Example:

\begin{stdout}
Enter number of rows: 6
+++++++++++
 +++++++++
  +++++++
   +++++
    +++
     +
\end{stdout}

{\em Hint}: make a table with the line number (starting at zero or one, but zero is probably better), the number of leading spaces you will need on the line, and the number of plus signs. Then figure out the mathematical relationships between the line number and the other two values. They will be linear relationships.
\end{exercise}
