\begin{exercise}
Write the following methods, each of which takes an array of \java{double} values as a parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \java{mean} method returns the arithmetic mean (average) of the array elements.

\item The \java{stdev} method returns the standard deviation of the array elements, using this formula
\begin{equation*}
s = \sqrt {{n \sum{x_i} ^2 - \left(\sum{x_i}\right)^2} \over {n (n - 1)}}
\end{equation*}

where $n$ is the number of items in the array, $\sum{x_i} ^2$ is the sum of the squares of the individual items, and $\left(\sum{x_i}\right)^2$ is the square of the total of all the items in the array.

\item The \java{standardize} returns a new array of the values converted to {\em standard scores}. First, calculate the mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$ of the entries in the original array. Each entry in the result array will be \java{(arr[i] - m) / s}. This method must call the \java{mean} and \java{stdev} methods.

Write a \java{main} method to test the \java{standardize} method. For example, an array with values
\java{\{47.0, 11.0, 10.0, 66.0, 8.5\}} will generate these standard scores: \java{\{0.700, -0.662, -0.700, 1.418, -0.756\}} (to three decimal places). 

\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Unlike the string reversal method shown in {\em Think Java}, where a program built a new string that had its characters in the reverse order of the original, in this exercise you will write a \java{void} method named \java{reverseInPlace} that takes an array of integers as its parameter and reverses the order of the items in the array--in place. In other words, you won't create a new array; you will change the order of the items within the array itself.

Write a \java{main} method that will test the method by reversing and displaying:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An empty array with no elements
\item An array with one element
\item An array with an even number of elements (more than two elements)
\item An array with an odd number of elements (more than three elements)
\end{enumerate}

To make your job easier, you might want to create a ``helper method'' named \java{reverseAndDisplay} that prints the array, calls \java{reverseInPlace} and prints the array (which should now be reversed).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
You can use an array of three \java{double} values to represent a {\em vector} in three-dimensional space. The first element represents the vector's $x$-component, the second its $y$ component, and the third its $z$ component, written as $(x, y, z)$. Write a program that has these methods, each of which takes two three-element arrays as parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \java{add}: Returns a vector (an array of length three) representing the sum of the parameters. The sum of $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is the vector $(x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2)$
\item \java{dotProduct}: Returns the {\em dot product} of the parameter vectors. The dot product of  $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is calculated as $x_1\cdot x_2 + y_1\cdot y_2 + z_1\cdot z_2$ 
\item \java{distance}: Returns the distance between the vectors $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ using the formula $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2}$
\end{itemize}

The \java{main} method will ask the user to enter two vectors and then display the sum, dot product, and distance between the vectors. To avoid repetitious code, you might want to write a \java{getVector} method that has a prompt and a \java{Scanner} as its parameters. This method will prompt the user for the three vector components and return an array of three \java{double} values.

Here is an example of what the program might look like:

\begin{stdout}
Enter components of the first vector,
separated by spaces: 2 1.5 4.1
Enter components of the second vector,
separated by spaces: 7 3.5 1.2
Sum of vectors: (9.000, 5.000, 5.300)
Distance between vectors: 6.116
Dot product of vectors: 24.170
\end{stdout}
